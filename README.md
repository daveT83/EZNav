# EZNav
An easy to use file navigation window written in java. If you do not wish to understand how the code works simply intialize the GUI run it and close it when it has terminated. You may, however, edit most if not all of the visuals as well as functionality if you wish. Once a file has been selected this software will return both the absolute path of the file as well as the name of the file.
